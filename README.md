### Update the README.md
Modify and add information about the new workshop/course.

### Delete the tmp folder
The tmp folder just supports this README file, so you can just delete it after modifying it.

## The branches

### main branch

The main branch is a folder template to create the actual materials for a workshop session. Notebooks, exercises and materials associated to them (like images) should be here. 
On the other hand, actual data and slides are too big for a GitHub repository. Read the next section about hosting data in a [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) repository. Consider what is the best strategy for hosting or sharing slides. For collaborative questions, there is a copy in SharePoint.

#### Hosting data in Zenodo

Zenodo is a Open Science data repository from the OpenAIRE project supported by [CERN](https://home.cern/) to ensure that everyone can join in Open Science. 
It allows researchers to upload many different types of data and gives each repository a unique and citeable identifier (DOI). 
We can also link a Github repository and whenever you create a release for the github repo, it will give it as well a DOI. 
Follow this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) for instructions 
We are using Zenodo to deposit complementary materials and data necessary for the course, relieving the size of the Github repo. It also makes it easier to update the materials and use them in the UCloud apps.

### webpage-mkdocs branch

The webpag-mkdocs branch contains all the content needed to create and deploy the self-learning part of the course/workshop. 
For more instructions, including how to set up Github Pages and automatic deploying of the webpage, check the README.md file from the [webpage branch](https://github.com/hds-sandbox/course-template/tree/webpage).
Note: MkDocs requires a lot of plugins, which can be deprecated over time. You can use the branch `webpage-quarto` which does not require extra packages and will be more longeve.

### webpage-quarto branch

The webpag-quarto branch contains - as above - an example of webpage to create and deploy the self-learning part of the course/workshop. Go to the branch to see what you need (`quarto` and few `R` packages) to get going.

### gh-deploy branch

The tool that we use to create the website is called [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the theme [`material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/).
Mkdocs has a specific command `mkdocs gh-deploy` that takes the content of a branch and creates and deploys the website in a new branch called "gh-deploy".
In our case, it would use the branch "webpage" to create our website. 
The branch "webpage" contains a github workflow that will automatically deploy the website using `mkdocs gh-deploy` whenever you push a commit to the webpage branch.
